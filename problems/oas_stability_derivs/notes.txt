Major source of the vector size:

get_vectors_force + mtx_assy_forces + eval_velocities  (GetMatrix + EvalVelMtx + EvalVelocities)
force_pts + mesh --> force_pts_velocities.
- Don't need intermediate calcs for anything else.
- They are huge (216 x 12 x 17 x 3)

Baring that, should the surfaces be solved by independent VL calculations instead of all together
